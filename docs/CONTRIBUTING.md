# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests and [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Use a consistent coding style. Run `pnpm format` to format your code or setup prettier in your editor.
7. Add changesets via the command `pnpm changeset`.
8. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../../issues)
